# Daily Map
Daily Map is a single page web application that provides a map with a list of restaurants in a specific area based on user choice.

It asynchronously integrates third party APIs such as [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) and [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) using [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started) requests. It follows MVVP design pattern by using [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com) framework.

This is my project for the [Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004) courses [Intro to AJAX](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ajax--ud110) and [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989).
